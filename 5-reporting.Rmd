# Reporting

There is probably a tonne of guidelines to how one should report statistical findings in the Results section. How I report below is what I commonly do which has served me well. I believe it very closely approximates many guideline recommendations.

## One-sample t test {#report-onettest}

For running the test, please see chapter \@ref(onettest). After running the test, this is what the result looks like in Figure \@ref(fig:1sample-ttest).

```{r, 1sample-ttest, fig.cap="One sample t test", out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE, eval=TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics("images/one_sample_ttest.png")

```

### Reporting

Ankle torque in the present cohort was statistically significantly greater than the hypothesized mean by 24.11 Nm/kg (t = 7.14, P < 0.001, 95%CI 17.09 to 31.14 Nm/kg).


## Independent t-test {#report-twottest}

For running the test, please see chapter \@ref(twottest).After running the test, this is what the result looks like in Figure \@ref(fig:two-sample-ttest).

```{r two-sample-ttest, fig.cap="Two sample t test", out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("images/two_sample_ttest.png")

```

### Reporting

Ankle torque in group `G` was not statistically different from group `T`, with a mean difference of -1.49 Nm/kg (t = -1.49, P = 0.833, 95%CI -15.97 to 13.00 Nm/kg).


## Paired t-test {#report-pairedttest}


For running the test, please see chapter \@ref(pairedttest). After running the test, this is what the result looks like in Figure \@ref(fig:paired-ttest).

```{r paired-ttest, fig.cap="Paired t test", out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("images/paired_ttest.png")

```

### Reporting

Ankle torque was 24.58 Nm/kg (t = 4.95, P < 0.001, 95%CI 13.34 to 35.81 Nm/kg) more after training than before training.


## One-way between ANOVA{#report-oneBetwtest}


For running the test, please see chapter \@ref(oneBetwtest). After running the test, this is what the result looks like in Figure \@ref(fig:one-between-anova-primary) and \@ref(fig:one-between-anova-posthoc).

Group 3 was not significantly different from group 1 (P = 0.074, mean difference of 13.77 95%CI -1.40 to 28.95 Nm/kg).


## One-way within ANOVA{#report-oneWithtest}


For running the test, please see chapter \@ref(oneWithtest). After running the test, this is what the result looks like in Figure \@ref(fig:one-within-anova-primary) and \@ref(fig:one-within-anova-posthoc).

Ankle torque in session 2 was not significantly different from 1 (P = 0.142, mean difference of -3.95 95%CI -9.34 to 1.44 Nm/kg). 

## Correlation{#report-corr}
